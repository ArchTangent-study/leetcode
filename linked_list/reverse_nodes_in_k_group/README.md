# Reverse Nodes in k-Group ([L025](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/))
Difficulty: **Hard**

## Problem

Given the `head` of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time, and return the *modified list*.

`k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as-is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 5000`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`

Follow-up: Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra memory space?
