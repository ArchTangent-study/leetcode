# Find the Duplicate Number ([L287](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/))
Difficulty: **Medium**

## Problem

Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return this *repeated number*.

You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums` and uses only constant extra space (`O(1)`).

Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 10⁵`
- `nums.length == n + 1`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the integers in `nums` appear only **once** except for **precisely one integer** which appears **two or more times**.

Follow up:
- How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in `nums`?
- Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity (`O(n)`)?
