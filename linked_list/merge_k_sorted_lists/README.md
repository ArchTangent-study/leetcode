Difficulty: **Hard**

## Problem

You are given an array of `k` linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

*Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it*.

Constraints:
- `k == lists.length`
- `0 <= k <= 10⁴`
- `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
- `-10⁴ <= lists[i][j] <= 10⁴`
- `lists[i]` is sorted in **ascending order**.
- The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10⁴`.
