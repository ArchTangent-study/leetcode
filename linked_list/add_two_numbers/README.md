# Add Two Numbers ([L002](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/))
Difficulty: **Medium**

## Problem

You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number `0` itself.

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does **not** have leading zeroes.
