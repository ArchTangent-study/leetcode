# Linked List Cycle ([L141](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/))
Difficulty: **Easy**

## Problem

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

Constraints:
- `The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10⁴]`.
- `-10⁵ <= Node.val <= 10⁵`
- `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.
