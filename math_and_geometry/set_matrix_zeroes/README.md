# Set Matrix Zeroes ([LC073](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/))
Difficulty: **Medium**

## Problem

Given an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix`, if an element is `0`, set its entire row and column to `0`s.

You must do it **in place**.

Constraints:
- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[0].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `-2³¹ <= matrix[i][j] <= 2³¹ - 1`

Follow up:
- A straightforward solution using `O(mn)` space is probably a bad idea.
- A simple improvement uses `O(m + n)` space, but still not the best solution.
- Could you devise a constant space (`O(1)`)solution?
