# Multiply Strings ([LC043](https://leetcode.com/problems/multiply-strings/))
Difficulty: **Medium**

## Problem

Given two *non-negative* integers `num1` and `num2` represented as *strings*, return the *product* of `num1` and `num2`, also represented as a *string*.

**Note**: You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

Constraints:
- `1 <= num1.length`, `num2.length <= 200`
- `num1` and `num2` consist of digits only.
- Both `num1` and `num2` do not contain any leading zero, except the number `0` itself.
