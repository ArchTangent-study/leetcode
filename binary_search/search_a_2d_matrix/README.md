# Search a 2D Matrix ([LC074](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/))
Difficulty: **Medium**

## Problem

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value `target` in an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix`. This matrix has the following properties:
- Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Constraints:
- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `-10⁴ <= matrix[i][j], target <= 10⁴`
