# leetcode
My approach to Leetcode and Blind problems, in Python.

## Structure
Problems are sorted based on *category* (Trees, Stack, Linked List, etc.) and *difficulty* (easy, medium, hard), and placed into their own folders.

Each problem folder should contain:
- a `test.py` file to ensure that the expected output is returned for given input.
- a `readme.md` file describing the problem.

## Resources
[neetcode](https://neetcode.io/) is a fantastic source of information on how to solve these problems.
