# leetcode
My approach to Leetcode and Blind problems, in Python and occasionally C.

## Structure
Problems are sorted based on category (Trees, Stack, Linked List, etc.), and placed into their own folders.

Each problem folder should contain:

A `readme.md` file describing the problem, difficulty (easy, medium, hard), and my results (time and space complexity rankings) from Leetcode, if any.  Additional sections may include:
- procedure
- thought process
- lessons learned
- alternative solutions

A `###-name-of-problem_#.py` file, where `###` is the Leetcode problem number.  This is my solution as submitted to LeetCode.

## Resources
[Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/) is a fantastic source of information on how to solve these problems.
