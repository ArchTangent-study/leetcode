# leetcode
My approach to Leetcode and Blind problems, in Python.

## Structure
Problems are sorted based on category (Trees, Stack, Linked List, etc.), and placed into their own folders.

Each problem folder should contain:
- a `readme.md` file describing the problem, difficulty (easy, medium, hard), and my results (time and space complexity rankings) from Leetcode, if any.
- a `###-name-of-problem.py` file, where `###` is the Leetcode problem number.  This is my solution as submitted to Leetcode.

## Resources
[Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/) is a fantastic source of information on how to solve these problems.
