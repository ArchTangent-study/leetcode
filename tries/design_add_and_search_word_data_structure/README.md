# Design Add and Search Word Data Structure ([LC211](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-add-and-search-words-data-structure/))
Difficulty: Medium

## Problem

Design a data structure that supports adding new words and finding if a string matches any previously added string.

Implement the `WordDictionary` class:
- `WordDictionary()` Initializes the object.
- `void addWord(word)` Adds word to the data structure, it can be matched later.
- `bool search(word)` Returns true if there is any string in the data structure that matches `word` or `false` otherwise. word may contain dots `'.'` where dots can be matched with any letter.

Constraints:
- `1 <= word.length <= 25`
- `word` in `addWord` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `word` in `search` consists of `'.'` or lowercase English letters.
- There will be at most `3` dots in `word` for search queries.
- At most `10⁴` calls will be made to `addWord` and `search`.
