# Word Search II ([LC212](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search-ii/))
Difficulty: Hard

## Problem

Given an `m x n` board of characters and a list of strings `words`, return *all words on the board*.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where **adjacent cells** are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

Constraints:
- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 12`
- `board[i][j]` is a lowercase English letter.
- `1 <= words.length <= 3 * 10⁴`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of words are unique.
