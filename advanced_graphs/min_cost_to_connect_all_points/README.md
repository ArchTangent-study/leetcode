# Min Cost to Connect All Points ([LC1584](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points/))
Difficulty: Medium

## Problem

You are given an array `points` representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`.

The cost of connecting two points `[xi, yi]` and `[xj, yj]` is the **manhattan distance** between them: `|xi - xj| + |yi - yj|`, where `|val|` denotes the absolute value of `val`.

Return the *minimum cost to make all points connected*. All points are connected if there is **exactly one** simple path between any two points.

Constraints:
- `1 <= points.length <= 1000`
- `-10⁶ <= xi, yi <= 10⁶`
- All pairs `(xi, yi)` are distinct.
