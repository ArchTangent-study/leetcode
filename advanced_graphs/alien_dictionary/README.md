# Alien Dictionary ([LC269](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/892/))
Difficulty: Hard

*Note*: this is a LeetCode premium question, also available via `LintCode` problem `892`.

## Problem

There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you. You receive a list of **non-empty** `words` from the dictionary, where `words` are **sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language**. *Derive the order of letters in this language*.

Notes:
- You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
- The dictionary is invalid, if string `a` is prefix of string `b` and `b` appears before `a`.
- If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
- There may be multiple valid order of letters, return the smallest in normal lexicographical order.
- The letters in **one** string are of the same rank by default and are sorted in Human dictionary order.
