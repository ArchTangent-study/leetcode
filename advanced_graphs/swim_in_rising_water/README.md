# Swim in Rising Water ([LC778](https://leetcode.com/problems/swim-in-rising-water/))
Difficulty: Hard

## Problem

You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid` where each value `grid[i][j]` represents the elevation at that point `(i, j)`.

The rain starts to fall. At time `t`, the depth of the water everywhere is `t`. You can swim from a square to another **4-directionally** adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most `t`. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.

Return *the least time until you can reach the bottom right square* `(n - 1, n - 1)` *if you start at the top left square* `(0, 0)`.

Constraints:
- `n == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 50`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] < n²`
- Each value `grid[i][j]` is unique.
