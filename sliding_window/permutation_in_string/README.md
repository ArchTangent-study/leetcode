Difficulty: **Medium**

## Problem

Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, return `true` if `s2` contains a permutation of `s1`, or `false` otherwise.

In other words, return `true` if one of `s1`'s permutations is the substring of `s2`.

Constraints:
- `1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 10⁴`
- `s1` and `s2` consist of lowercase English letters.
