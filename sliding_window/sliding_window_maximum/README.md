Difficulty: **Hard**

## Problem

You are given an array of integers `nums`, there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the *max sliding window*.

Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10⁵`
- `-10⁴ <= nums[i] <= 10⁴`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`
