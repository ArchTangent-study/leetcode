# Minimum Window Substring ([LC076](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/))
Difficulty: **Hard**

## Problem

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return the ***minimum window substring*** of `s` such that every character in `t` (***including duplicates***) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string `""`.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

Constraints:
- `m == s.length`
- `n == t.length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10⁵`
- `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
