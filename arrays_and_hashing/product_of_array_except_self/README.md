# Product of Array Except Self ([LC238](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/))
Difficulty: **Medium**

## Problem

Given an integer array nums, return an array `answer` *such that* `answer[i]` *is equal to the product of all the elements of* `nums` *except* `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.
Constraints:
- `2 <= nums.length <= 10⁵`
- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
- The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

**Follow up**: Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity? (The output array **does not count** as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

## Thought Process

Edge Cases / Caveats / Pitfalls:
- Can't use division
- Must have `O(n)` runtime complexity
