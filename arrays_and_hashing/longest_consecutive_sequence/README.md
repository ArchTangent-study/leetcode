# Longest Consecutive Sequence ([LC128](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/))
Difficulty: **Medium**

## Problem

Given an ***unsorted*** array of integers `nums`, return *the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence*.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

Constraints:
- `0 <= nums.length <= 10⁵`
- `-10⁹ <= nums[i] <= 10⁹`

## Thought Process

Edge Cases / Caveats / Pitfalls:
- `nums` is unsorted.
- Must run in `O(n)` time.
