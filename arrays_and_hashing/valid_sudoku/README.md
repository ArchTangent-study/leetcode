# Valid Sudoku ([LC036](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/))
Difficulty: **Medium**

## Problem
Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following **rules**:
1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

Note:
- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is ***not necessarily solvable***.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

Constraints:
- `board.length == 9`
- `board[i].length == 9`
- `board[i][j]` is a digit `1-9` or `'.'`.
