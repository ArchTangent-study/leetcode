# Surrounded Regions ([LC130](https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/))
Difficulty: Medium

## Problem

Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, *capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by* `'X'`.

A region is **captured** by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

Constraints:
- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.
