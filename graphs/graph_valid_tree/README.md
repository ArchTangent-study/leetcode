# Graph Valid Tree ([LC261](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/178/))
Difficulty: Medium

*Note*: this is a LeetCode premium question, also available via `LintCode` problem `178`.

## Problem

Given `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and a list of **undirected** `edges` (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.

*Note*: You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are *undirected*, `[0, 1]` is the same as `[1, 0]` and thus will not appear together in `edges`.
