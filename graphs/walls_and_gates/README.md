# Walls and Gates ([LC286](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/663/))
Difficulty: Medium
*Note*: this is a LeetCode premium question, also available via `LintCode` problem `6663`.

## Problem

You are given a `m x n` 2D grid initialized with these three possible values:
- `1`: A wall or an obstacle.
- `0`: A gate.
- `INF`: Infinity means an empty room.

We use the value `2^31 - 1 = 2147483647` to represent `INF` as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than `2147483647`.

Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a `Gate`, that room should remain filled with `INF`.
