# Longest Increasing Subsequence ([LC300](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/))
Difficulty: **Medium**

## Problem

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, `[3,6,2,7]` is a subsequence of the array `[0,3,1,6,2,2,7]`.

Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
- `-10⁴ <= nums[i] <= 10⁴`
