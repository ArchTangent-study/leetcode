# Two Sum II - Input Array is Sorted ([LC167](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/))
Difficulty: **Medium**

## Problem

Given a **1-indexed** array of integers `numbers` that is already ***sorted in non-decreasing order***, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1₁` and `numbers[index₂]` where `1 <= index₁ < index₂ <= numbers.length`.

Return the indices of the two numbers, `index₁` and `index₂`, ***added by one*** as an *integer array* `[index₁, index₂]` of *length 2*.

The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**. You **may not** use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant (`O(1)`) extra space.

Constraints:
- `2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 10⁴`
- `-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000`
- numbers is sorted in **non-decreasing order**.
- `-1000 <= target <= 1000`
- The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**.
