# Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation ([LC150](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/))
Difficulty: **Medium**

## Problem

Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in [Reverse Polish Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

Valid operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

*Note*: division between two integers should truncate toward zero.

It is guaranteed that the given RPN expression is *always valid*. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result, and there will not be any division by zero operation.

Constraints:
- `1 <= tokens.length <= 10⁴`
- `tokens[i]` is either an operator: `"+"`, `"-"`, `"*"`, or `"/"`, or an integer in the range `[-200, 200]`.
