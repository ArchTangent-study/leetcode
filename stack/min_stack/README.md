# Min Stack ([LC155](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/))
Difficulty: **Easy**

## Problem

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the MinStack class:
- `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.
- `void push(int val)` pushes the element val onto the stack.
- `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.
- `int top()` gets the top element of the stack.
- `int getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

Constraints:
- `-2³¹ <= val <= 2³¹ - 1`
- Methods `pop`, `top` and `getMin` operations will always be called on **non-empty** stacks.
- At most `3 * 10⁴` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `getMin`.
