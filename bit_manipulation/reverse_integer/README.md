# Reverse Integer ([LC007](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/))
Difficulty: **Medium**

## Problem

Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its *digits reversed*. If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range `[-2³¹, 2³¹ - 1]`, then return `0`.

**Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned)**.

Constraints:
- `-2³¹ <= x <= 2³¹ - 1`

## Thought Process

Edge Cases / Caveats / Pitfalls:
- Leading zeroes when reversing
- Numbers outside of signed 32-bit integer range
