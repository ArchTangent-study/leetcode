Difficulty: **Medium**

## Problem

Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`, return *the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping*.

Constraints:
- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10⁵`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `-5 * 10⁴ <= start_i < end_i <= 5 * 10⁴`
