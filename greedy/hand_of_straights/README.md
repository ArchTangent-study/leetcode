Difficulty: **Medium**

## Problem

Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size `groupSize`, and consists of `groupSize` consecutive cards.

Given an integer array hand where `hand[i]` is the value written on the `ith` card and an integer `groupSize`, return `true` if she can rearrange the cards, or `false` otherwise.

Constraints:
- `1 <= hand.length <= 10⁴`
- `0 <= hand[i] <= 10⁹`
- `1 <= groupSize <= hand.length`
