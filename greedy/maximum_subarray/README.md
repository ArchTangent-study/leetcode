# Maximum Subarray ([LC053](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/))
Difficulty: **Easy**

## Problem

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return *its sum*.

A **subarray** is a **contiguous** part of an array.

Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10⁵`
- `-10⁴ <= nums[i] <= 10⁴`

Follow up: If you have figured out the `O(n)` solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
