# Gas Station ([LC134](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/))
Difficulty: **Medium**

## Problem

There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `ith` station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `ith `station to its next `(i + 1)th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return *the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return* `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**.

Constraints:
- `n == gas.length == cost.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10⁵`
- `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 10⁴`
