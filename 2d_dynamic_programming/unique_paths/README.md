# Unique Paths ([LC062](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/))
Difficulty: **Medium**

## Problem

There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return *the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner*.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 10‚Åπ`.

Constraints:
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
