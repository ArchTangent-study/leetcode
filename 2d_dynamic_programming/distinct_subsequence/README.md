# Distinct Subsequences ([LC115](https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences/))
Difficulty: **Hard**

## Problem

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return *the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t`*.

A string's **subsequence** is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the remaining characters' relative positions. (i.e., `"ACE"` is a subsequence of `"ABCDE"` while `"AEC"` is not).

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length`, `t.length <= 1000`
- `s` and `t` consist of English letters.
