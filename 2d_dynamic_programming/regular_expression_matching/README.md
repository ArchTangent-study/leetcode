# Regular Expression Matching ([LC010](https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/))
Difficulty: **Hard**

## Problem

Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'` where:
- `'.'` Matches any single character.​​​​
- `'*'` Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).

Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 20`
- `1 <= p.length <= 30`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
- `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'.'`, and `'*'`.
- It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character `'*'`, there will be a previous valid character to match.
