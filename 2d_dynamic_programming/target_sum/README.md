# Target Sum ([LC494](https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum/))
Difficulty: **Medium**

## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`.

You want to build an **expression** out of `nums` by adding one of the symbols `'+'` and `'-'` before each integer in nums and then concatenate all the integers.
- For example, if `nums = [2, 1]`, you can add a `'+'` before `2` and a `'-'` before `1` and concatenate them to build the expression `"+2-1"`.

Return the number of different **expressions** that you can build, which evaluates to `target`.

Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 20`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `0 <= sum(nums[i]) <= 1000`
- `-1000 <= target <= 1000`
