# Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix ([LC329](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/))
Difficulty: **Hard**

## Problem

Given an `m x n` integers `matrix`, return *the length of the longest increasing path in `matrix`*.

From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You may **not** move **diagonally** or **move outside the boundary** (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).

Constraints:
- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 2³¹ - 1`
